    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
    The purpose of this website is to build revenue for Big Drop Outfitters by promoting our 
    facility, services, and the unique experiences we offer. Our site provides essential 
    information such as safety instructions, preparation tips, packing suggestions, details on 
    equipment, and the river routes available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Visitors can explore camping options in the area with interactive maps for directions, 
    weather updates, and information on local activities and events. We also highlight our 
    business partners and share exclusive savings opportunities, along with links to local 
    businesses to strengthen community connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    To increase revenue and simplify planning, guests can schedule and book their visits 
    directly through the site. We encourage engagement by allowing visitors to share their 
    photos, stories, and experiences. A feedback questionnaire with a grading scale will help 
    us improve our services and showcase customer satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website also features a calendar of community events, contests and winners, and 
    visitor-friendly content such as recipes, camping tips, and activity guides. In addition, 
    we clearly communicate our rules, mission statement, and motto to ensure visitors 
    understand both what we offer and what we expect, fostering a safe and memorable adventure.
