  <h2>Pat Blau</h2>

  <main>
    <p>Hi everyone, I am Pat. The photo is of me and my husband. We were 
    high school sweet hearts and dated for 5 years. We ended up going in 
    separate directions and after 30 years got a second chance. We have 
    been married for 5 years and sealed for 2. We live in Waynesville, MO 
    and plan to have a camping facility here in the future. It's our 
    retirement plan.</p>

    <p>My education has been focused on skills that will help make our
    business a success. I am working on a degree in Computer Technology.</p>

    <p>I enjoy baking, taking photos, crafts, and family history.</p>
