    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
    The purpose of this website is to build revenue for Big Drop Outfitters by promoting our 
    facility, services, and the unique experiences we offer. Our site provides essential 
    information such as safety instructions, preparation tips, packing suggestions, details on 
    equipment, and the river routes available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Visitors can explore camping options in the area with interactive maps for directions, 
    weather updates, and information on local activities and events. We also highlight our 
    business partners and share exclusive savings opportunities, along with links to local 
    businesses to strengthen community connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    To increase revenue and simplify planning, guests can schedule and book their visits 
    directly through the site. We encourage engagement by allowing visitors to share their 
    photos, stories, and experiences. A feedback questionnaire with a grading scale will help 
    us improve our services and showcase customer satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website also features a calendar of community events, contests and winners, and 
    visitor-friendly content such as recipes, camping tips, and activity guides. In addition, 
    we clearly communicate our rules, mission statement, and motto to ensure visitors 
    understand both what we offer and what we expect, fostering a safe and memorable adventure.

  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <h3>Our Target Audience</h3>
  <p>
    Our target customers are families, groups of friends, and outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy

    Most of our customers are between their mid-20s and mid-50s, with moderate disposable income 
    they are eager to spend on memorable outdoor experiences. They value connection, adventure, 
    and affordability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our guests want easy access to safe, well-planned outdoor activities that go beyond rafting. 
    They are looking for options that include camping, local attractions, and events that can 
    round out their vacation.

    and one-stop booking that simplifies the planning process. By offering discounts with business 
    partners and linking to local businesses, we make their trip both easier and more affordable.
  </p>

  <h2>Branding</h2>
  <h3>"Big Water. Big Mountains. Big Fun."</h3>
  <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in 
     a nice font :) -->
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patblau/wwd130b/main/wwr%20/images/logo.png" alt="Logo image" />
    
    <p>
      Our branding focuses on the thrill of whitewater rafting combined with the beauty of 
      mountainous landscapes. The logo features bold, dynamic typography that conveys energy 
      and excitement, while the color palette reflects the natural environmentâ€”blues and greens 
      representing water and forests, complemented by earthy tones that evoke the rugged terrain.

<h3>Big Drop Outfitters</h3>

<h4>Paragraph Font Example</h4>
<p>
  The best Whitewater Rafting Colorado has to offer. Big Drop Outfitters
  offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
  Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
  Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
</p>

<h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
<p class="colored">
  Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
  physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
  adventures you are seeking, Big Drop Outfitters can make it happen for you.
