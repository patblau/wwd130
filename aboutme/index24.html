<p>Hi everyone, I am Pat. The photo is of me and my husband. We were high school sweet hearts and dated for 5 years. We ended up going in separate directions and after 30 years got a second chance. We have been married for 5 years and sealed for 2. We live in Waynesville, MO and plan to have a camping facility here in the future. It's our retirement plan.</p>
<p>I enjoy taking photos, crafts, and family history.</p>
